# 👋 Welcome to b1sted labs!
### My personal digital workshop

This is my space for coding, experimenting with new ideas, and learning through building. Here you'll find a collection of my projects, from simple command-line tools to more complex applications, all crafted with a focus on clean code and robust solutions.

## 🚀 Currently in Development

Right now, my main focus is on a classic game, implemented from scratch to sharpen fundamental skills.

#### 🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors (in C99)
A classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors I'm implementing in C99. My goal is to practice core programming principles, memory management, and creating a clean, portable command-line application.
