# 👋 Welcome to b1sted labs!
### My personal digital workshop

This is my space for coding, experimenting with new ideas, and learning through building. Here you'll find a collection of my projects, from simple command-line tools to more complex applications, all crafted with a focus on clean code and robust solutions.

## ✨ Featured Project

My latest completed work is a deep dive into the fundamentals of C programming through a classic game.

#### 🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors (in C99)
A classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors implemented from scratch in C99. This project was an exercise in core programming principles, memory management, and creating a clean, modular, and portable command-line application. It's fully documented and includes a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds.
